# Algorithm
# -------------------------------------------------------
# 1.  Identify the number of devices using each wifi channel in the neighborhood and copy the information to a file-channel.txt. 
# 2.  Create a 2D list - (channel_list) with channel number and number of devices using the channel as its attributes.
# 3.  Count the channel occupancy of each channel in "channel.txt" and assign it to the corresponding channel on the channel_list. 
# 4.  Create a 2D list - (channel_check) for the non overlapping channels (1,6 & 11).
# 5.  Extract the information related to the non-overlapping channels in "channel_list" and assign them to corresponding channels in "channel_check".
# 6.  Sort the channel_check in descending order based on channel occupancy to find the least occupied channel among the non-overlapping channels.
# 7.  If the least occupancy among non-overlapping channels is less than 5(threshold) then choose the least occupied channel of channel_check.
# 8.  Else sort the channel_list in descending order based on channel occupancy and choose the least occupied channel among them.
# 9.  Stop the hostapd software to make changes in its configuration file.
# 10. Assign the chosen channel number to the channel attribute of /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf file.
# 11. Start the hostapd software and find the access point using the chosen felicitous channel number.
