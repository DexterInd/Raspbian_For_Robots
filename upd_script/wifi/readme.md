# Wifi Repository

Here we are storing files for updating the wifi on Raspbian.  Dexter Industries wifi module is based on the EDUP EP-N8508GS module.  This is based on Realtek RTL8188CUS 802.11n WLAN Adapter .

Running "sudo ./update_wifi.sh" will update the wifi to the latest version.

This package of drivers should enable AdHoc Access with the EDUP dongle.
